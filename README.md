# 1_Inappriopriate_Graph_coloring_SL_order
Greedy algorithm for 1-Inappriopriate coloring using SL order - coloring nodes in Smallest Last order, which means that nodes with smallest degree are colored last. 
1-Inappriopriate means that node can have maximum one neighbor in the same color as that node.
Graphs in txt files are build by schema: first value is number of nodes, pairs of values are edge between nodes
